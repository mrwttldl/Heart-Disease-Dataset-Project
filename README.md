Evaluation of some factors that may be important in heart diseases using Naive Bayes, KNN and SVM and making predictions

About Data
Heart diseases can be due to a variety of reasons, so we may need to evaluate some qualifications.This data set  consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, 
Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 

0 =  no disease 
1 = disease.

The properties of the data set :
1.	Age (In years)
2.	Sex 1 - Male 0 - Female
3.	CP (Chest Pain Type)  0 - Typical Angina (Heart related) 1 - Atypical Angina (Non-heart related) 2 - Non-Anginal pain (Non-heart related) 3 - Asymptomatic (No disease)
4.	TRESTBPS (Resting Blood Pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
5.	CHOL (Serum Cholestoral in mg/dl) Healthy serum cholesterol is less than 200 mg/dL
6.	FPS (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) 1 - True 0 - False
7.	RESTECH (Resting Electro Cardio Graphic results)
8.	THALACH (Maximum heart rate achieved)
9.	EXANG (Exercise induced Angina) 1 - Yes 0 - No
10.	OLDPEAK (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
11.	SLOPE (Slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
12.	CA (Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by Flouroscopy)
13.	THAL 0 - Normal 1 - Fixed defect 2 - Reversible defect
14.	TARGET 1 - Heart Problem 0 - No Heart Problem
